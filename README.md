## the project is doomed for now 

Google , Microsoft and most of the big Email providers are blocking the third party image links 

for example i added `<img href="http://172.104.130.244/go/xZEhy" />`
When i send it google downloads the image and cache's it on its CDN and send it as `src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/KHvSmyClWP-auYQ9FMpNr4vuGm_iZ5xGxGoQpqj15DCXVKk4XFTLKdlAIzdiG_lQZ0StlwBxtYMFxXXiDD9yTjK2spVzJ_-6gEa4Eh7PBwhS0TlodWokHkhB444HeUf-pAwfHN5dfgEd=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mailtrack.io/trace/mail/260062aa4d98f5b8051cc475f9b40950b42fa050.png?u=8655198"`

so i only get the initial ping by google and nothing more

a help on this would be appreciated
