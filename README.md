## the project is doomed for now 

Google , Microsoft and most of the big Email providers are blocking the third party image links 

for example i added `<img href="http://172.104.130.244/go/xZEhy" />`
When i send it google downloads the image and cache's it on its CDN and send it as `<img src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/V1mUEHXAAWLfElAVHGbSHaFAyb3WvlsqiVABR5TAIDpABZXKO8NjsI4MlIbLoGELpTg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://172.104.130.244/go/xZEhy" class="CToWUd">
`

so i only get the initial ping by google and nothing more

a help on this would be appreciated
